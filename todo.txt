-check the dimensions, units
-check convergence

- try to use curve fit to fit single peaks ()
- takens embedding --> wassertein distance --> optimize.

question:
1- This model made under the assumption that the ocillations occur spontenously. 
Is this the case in the experiment?
2- from the paper " In many of the astrocytes that display spontaneous activity, the time
between spikes tends to be longer than 100"


conclusions:
we need high values of Y, around ~4,5 to initate an ocillation

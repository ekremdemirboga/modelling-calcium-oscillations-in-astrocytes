-check the dimensions, units
-check convergence

1- use curve fit to fit single peaks
2- takens embedding+wassertein distance+optimize.

question:
1- this model made under the assumption that the ocillations occur spontenously. 
Is this the case in the experiment?
2- from the paper " In many of the astrocytes that display spontaneous activity, the time
between spikes tends to be longer than 100"

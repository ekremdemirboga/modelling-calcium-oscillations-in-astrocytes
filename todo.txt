check the dimensions, units
check convergence
understand physics of the eqn
understand data, ask nick 
define a distance function
find a way to minimize the function

question:
1- this model made under the assumption that the ocillations occur spontenously. 
Is this the case in the experiment?
2- from the paper " In many of the astrocytes that display spontaneous activity, the time
between spikes tends to be longer than 100"
